            Robert loves to Treasure Hunt! He has found really interesting items
            in the past years. “I look for yard sales and places where people
            may look like they’re hoarding stuff. I see them collecting
            treasures of their own. I usually go to those places and almost
            always end up finding something worth the trip. These include old
            watches, jewelry, collectible items, branded clothes, coins,
            silverware, and many others.” - Robert Bridda

            He has found his main inspirations through traveling. While doing
            so, he discovered interesting items that he could acquire and sell
            such as rocks and minerals. One of his favorite states is Arizona
            due to their diveresity of minerals that can be found in the desert.

            This is Robert’s first meeting with his dog SKIPPER! Rescuing his
            dog was one of the best accomplishments he has done. Robert takes
            Skipper on many journeys during his work or travels. “I found
            Skipper on a rescue website while looking at dogs online. I was
            originally only thinking about the possibility of getting a dog but
            wasn’t fully ready to commit. I found myself really liking his
            picture and wanted to give it a try and see how I felt seeing him in
            person. It was love at first sight! I went back home with the regret
            of not taking him. I eventually counted every minute to pick him up
            the next day. This was the best decision I have ever made. We are
            best friends and I take him everywhere I go.” - Robert Bridda
