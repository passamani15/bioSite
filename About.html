            Robert is a Treasure Hunter. He lives in Washington Township, NJ and
            spends his time finding valuable items to collect and sell. His main
            focus is to acquire precious minerals and other collectibles such as
            gold, natural gems, old watches, stamps, coins, and many others.
            After making connections and gaining more experience looking for the
            right items to sell, what started as a hobby in 2020, has become his
            full-time job. 
          <br>Fitness and Health have become part of his way of
            living. He is inspired to take his passion into helping others with
            their health goals, by starting a healing house in the future. For
            now, he does his best at taking care of his fitness and eating
            healthy as well as helping his family and friends get rid of bad
            eating habits. </br>

            His love for health is tied to his love for farming. Before becoming
            his own boss, Robert has worked in farms taking care of animals.
            This has made him passionate about farming, growing foods, and
            taking care of many animals he grew to love. When possible, he makes
            traveling part of his job, as well as part of his hobbies. He grew
            his passion by traveling to Arizona and discovering more about rock
            hounding when he was younger. 
            <br > Robert’s best friend is named
            “Skipper”! He is an Australian Shepherd dog that was rescued by
            Robert when he least expected. They are quite inseparable nowadays.
            Robert’s inspirations for the future come from the bond he
            experienced with others, and nature. His life goals were made to
            help those around him, as well as in the past or present. </br>
