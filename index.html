          “My goal is to become financially free to invest and travel and find
          more treasured things in life. My ultimate career goal would be to
          settle on a farm as a chiropractor. Living and providing a healing
          house for people to visit and help them, retain youth and longevity
          with herbal and orthopedic remedies.”- Robert Bridda

          Fitness and Health have been a major aspect of Robert’s journey. He
          dedicates a big part of his time trying to help others practice a
          healthier lyfestyle (including himself). His family plays an important
          part in his motivation.

          Robert hopes to have a farm of his own after years of experience
          working at farms. He gained his experience on taking care of animals
          as well as the agricultural side of farming. This has also grown on
          his love for animals, and the cows surely think that HE IS A CATCH!
